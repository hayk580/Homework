//1.Modify enum YourCards in quiz question 4 to demonstrate that the value of Queen can be 45.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
	enum YourCards { Ace = 43, Jack, Queen, King };
	std::cout << Queen;
	return 0;

//2.Write a program that demonstrates that the size of an unsigned integer and a normal integer are the same, and that both are smaller in size than a long integer.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "The size of unsigned int is: " << sizeof(unsigned int) << std::endl
		<< "The size of int is: " << sizeof(int) << std::endl <<
		"The size of long integer is: " << sizeof(long int);

	return 0;
}

//3.Write a program to calculate the area and circumference of a circle where the radius is fed by the user.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
	const double pi = 3.14;
	double radius;
	std::cout << "Enter the radius of the circle: ";
	std::cin >> radius;
	double area = pi * (radius * radius);
	double circumference = 2 * pi * radius;
	std::cout << "The area is: " << area << std::endl << "The circumference is: " << circumference;
	return 0;
